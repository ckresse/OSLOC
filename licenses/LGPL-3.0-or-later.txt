USE CASE Binary delivery Of Linked work With Header files Of Library Included In Linked work | The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library
	IF Substantial work | if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length) || What does the limit of ten or fewer lines refer to?: The quantitative limitation obviously refers to the adjective "small" which is thus defined in more detail. The LGPL-3.0 mentions "small macros, inline functions and templates" while also here "numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors" can be adapted regardless of their size. Linguistically, the reference of "ten or fewer lines in length" is emphasized in LGPL-3.0 by using "or" instead of "and" before "small macros, inline functions and templates".

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.
