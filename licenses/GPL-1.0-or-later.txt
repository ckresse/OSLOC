With the evolution of distributed software development and the miniaturization of storage media this is no longer possible. However, it would be possible to do so in electronic form. Since the license may, in fact, require that all holders of rights be listed, a more defensive interpretation probably would recommend to provide a complete list of copyright notices in a file and convey it on a data carrier along with the program.

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.
