USE CASE Source code delivery | You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it
	YOU MUST Provide Copyright notice | publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice || Done by default: Usually no separate action required, since copyright notices normally are included in the source code.

	YOU MUST NOT Modify Warranty disclaimer (Warranty disclaimer) | keep intact all the notices that refer*to the absence of any warranty
	YOU MUST Provide License text | give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License || Done by default: Usually no separate action required, since the license text normally is included in the source code delivery.
	IF Software modification | You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it
		YOU MUST Grant License | cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties

			YOU MUST Display Copyright notice | you must cause it*to print or display*an appropriate copyright notice || All or some : At the time when this license was written, software normally did not have more than a couple of authors, and labels with their copyright notices could easily be published on a copy, since disk sleeves used to be large enough for this purpose. With the evolution of distributed software development and the miniaturization of storage media this is no longer possible. However, it would be possible to do so in electronic form. Since the license may, in fact, require that all holders of rights be listed, a more defensive interpretation probably would recommend to provide a complete list of copyright notices in a file and convey it on a data carrier along with the program.

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.
