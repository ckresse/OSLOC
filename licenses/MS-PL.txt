PATENT HINTS Yes | each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents | If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.
COPYLEFT CLAUSE Questionable | only under this license | under a license that complies with this license || Unclear copyleft condition : It is unclear whether "any portion of the software" assumes code changes and additions that also must be distributed "only under this license". In addition, a "license that complies with this license" may or may not be interpreted as a copyleft clause. If not, the copyleft condition would depend on the mode of delivery which would require a case-by-case assessment. Therefore, a general recommendation on the compatibility of the MS-PL license can only be given for selected cases.
