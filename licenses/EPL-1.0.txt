COMPATIBILITY Apache-2.0 ||| Effectively tolerated by right holders: Review of a large number of use cases indicates that this compatibility can be considered to be generally tolerated. On request, the license stewart of the EPL-1.0, the Eclipse Foundation, stated that it is their practice that software components under permissive licenses such as MIT, BSD-3-Clause, and Apache-2.0 may be included in EPL-1.0 and EPL-2.0 licensed components.
COMPATIBILITY Artistic-2.0 || allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under*a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.

Thus, historically, EPL-1.0 is the successor license to CPL-1.0, and it is generally accepted that the right to release new versions of the license, under which software can be relicensed by contributors, is transferred to the Eclipse Foundation (for further information see https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/).
