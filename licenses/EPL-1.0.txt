COMPATIBILITY Apache-2.0 ||| Effectively tolerated by right holders: Review of a large number of use cases indicates that this compatibility can be considered to be generally tolerated. On request, the license stewart of the EPL-1.0, the Eclipse Foundation, stated that it is their practice that software components under permissive licenses such as MIT, BSD-3-Clause, and Apache-2.0 may be included in EPL-1.0 and EPL-2.0 licensed components.

COMPATIBILITY CPL-1.0 || after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program*under the new version ||| Community acceptance: When IBM, the original license steward of the CPL-1.0, passed the stewardship to the Eclipse Foundation, the new version of the CPL-1.0 was renamed EPL-1.0. Thus, historically, EPL-1.0 is the successor license to CPL-1.0, and it is generally accepted that the right to release new versions of the license, under which software can be relicensed by contributors, is transferred to the Eclipse Foundation (for further information see https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/).
