The LGPL-2.0 mentions "small macros and small inline functions" while "numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors" can be adopted regardless of size.

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement.
