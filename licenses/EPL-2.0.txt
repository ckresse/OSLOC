Thus, historically, EPL-1.0 is the successor license to CPL-1.0, and it is generally accepted that the right to release new versions of the license, under which software can be relicensed by contributors, is transferred to the Eclipse Foundation (for further information see https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/).
