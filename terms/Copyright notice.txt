The Copyright notice indicates the name of the holder of the exclusive usage rights. In its minimal form, it may only contain a name in an obvious context. Usually, however, the copyright notice includes the word "copyright", the Â© symbol or the letter c in parentheses "(c)", and a number or several numbers that indicate the year when the work was created. Optionally, this may be followed by an attribution to the author.
