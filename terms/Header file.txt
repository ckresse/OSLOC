A number of computer languages notably the C and C++ language allow to include other files that may contain any language constructs, but usually short assignments and definitions. Since such files normally are included at the beginning of a source file, they are referred to as Header files. They are typically used in combination with a library and contain function prototypes, data structures and definitions that are needed to compile source code that is intended to be linked to the library.
