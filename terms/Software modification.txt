The term Software modification refers to a situation where parts or all of an existing software is deleted, modified, expanded, combined with other components and/or otherwise altered in such a way that particular legal consequences occur as described in the license terms. Which alterations are classified as Software modification may be defined individually by a license and relate in particular to the scope of a copyleft clause.
