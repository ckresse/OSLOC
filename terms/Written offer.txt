When a license requests a Written offer to be made, then it normally refers to a section in the paperwork that is accompanying a product such as a manual. The Written offer must not necessarily be printed on paper but may also be provided in a text file on a portable or built-in storage medium. If the Written offer relates to software that is transmitted in a data stream via a network link, then the Written offer may be transmitted as a text file using the same means of communication.
