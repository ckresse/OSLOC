The Trademark notice contains attribution information of a particular registered trademark. In contrast to the Copyright notice, there is less formal tradition of how a Trademark notice should be phrased, but it should at least contain the name of the individual or the organization who owns the trademark, its registration number and the issuing intellectual property office.
