The term Modification report is used in the context of a source code modification and clearly documents in which way the source code was modified. This includes reporting the line numbers where modifications were applied; a so-called context diff is best suitable for this purpose. Should the source code modification result in a different user experience, this must be documented as well and the users' manual, if any, be adapted.
