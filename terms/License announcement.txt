The License announcement is a message that contains the name of the license, its version and, if not requested elsewhere, information where the full text of the license can be obtained.
A program may implement the functionality of a License announcement differently depending on whether it is a command-line programs or one with a graphical user interface: A command-line program typically writes a text line with the License announcement just after the program was started to its output path. A program with a graphical user interface usually provides a menu entry labeled 'About' or similar which, when selected, shows a message window containing the License announcement on screen.
