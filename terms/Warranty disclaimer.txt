The license text may contain a Warranty disclaimer clause or several clauses where the original authors refuse any warranty or liability for malfunction or damages that may occur when using the licensed software.
If the text of the Warranty disclaimer is part of the license text, any obligation on the license text such as Forwarding it along with the product implicitly also applies to the Warranty disclaimer resulting in an implicit license obligation. On the other hand, some licenses explicitly mention the Warranty disclaimer separately, but this does not necessarily mean that it must be treated (e.g. forwarded or published) separately.
