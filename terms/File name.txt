The term File name is used in the context of a program's source code. It denotes the name that can be used to identify a particular file in an archive or in a file system. If several files with the same name exist, the file name must be prefixed with the complete directory path or with at least as much of it to make it unique. If a non-standard encoding is used for the file name, the encoding must be specified.
