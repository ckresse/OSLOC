Copyright law specifies a Work as any artifact that was created by a human being, can be perceived by a human being and possesses individual characteristics that are attributable to a human being. In the context of software licensing, the term Work is used to denote a collection of software components that are conveyed as a whole under the same license or, if compatible, under the same group of applicable licenses.
