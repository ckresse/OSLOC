A software distribution may contain material not in a human-readable programming language, but in binary machine or intermediate code that was generated from the project's source code using a compiler. Some licenses may then impose disclosure obligations that may be fulfilled either by delivering the corresponding source code along with the binary code or by offering to do so at a later date. Irrespective of whether disclosure obligations exist and how they must be fulfilled, when software is delivered at least partly in object form then this is referred to as Binary delivery.
