The term Public domain refers to works that are not covered by copyright, i.e. are free to the public. The term is particularly relevant in the United States since authors can abandon their property rights. Public domain software can then be used by anyone without any restrictions. In Germany and most other European countries, authors can not abandon their copyright based on considerations of personal rights. Abandonment of copyright in the U.S. therefore may be interpreted as a license without obligations for the licensee in states where abandonment is not possible.
