The term Delayed delivery is only relevant, if the license permits to deliver the licensed software as a binary object and to deliver other materials separately at a later date.
The term Delayed delivery means any delivery of mateial that is not directly connected to the delivery of the binary object.
If the object code is embodied in physical form and delivered in a parcel or similar, then any delivery of material that is not accompanying the object code in the same parcel is considered Delayed delivery.
If the object code is delivered in a software archive as data stream for example to be downloaded from a server, then other material must be contained in the same archive or at least be part of the same download action in order not to be considered Delayed delivery.
