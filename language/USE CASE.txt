Sometimes the license obligations may allow the distributor to freely select between a number of optional use cases; the USE CASE element is introduced for this purpose. Several USE CASE elements to which the same license conditions apply may be combined using the OR language element. If a particular USE CASE is mentioned repeatedly, e.g. once along with another USE CASE and once not, the obligations of all USE CASE sections must be fulfilled.
