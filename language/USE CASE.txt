Sometimes the license obligations may allow the distributor to freely select between a number of optional use cases; the USE CASE language construct is introduced for this purpose. Several USE CASE language constructs to which the same license conditions apply may be combined using the OR language construct. If a particular USE CASE is mentioned repeatedly, e.g. once along with another USE CASE and once not, the obligations of all USE CASE sections must be fulfilled.
