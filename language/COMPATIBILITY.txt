A license may contain an explicit rule stating that software that is licensed under a particular other license can be combined, copied and distributed along with software that is licensed under the current license. Such other licenses are specified and referenced in this language construct as compatible. Note that a separate statement made anywhere else but not in the license text - even by the authors of the license text - is not accepted here. Exception: Non-copyleft licenses are considered compatible among each other.
